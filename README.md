# Laakmann Book Tasks (Python)

Solutions to algorithmic problems from *Cracking the Coding Interview*  
(6th Edition) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, implemented in **Python**.

This repository aims to go beyond a simple collection of solved problems — it is organized to:
- clearly capture algorithmic patterns;
- document reasoning, complexity analysis, and edge cases;
- provide an interview-ready reference for practice and review.
